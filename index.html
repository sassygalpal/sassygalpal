<p>Welcome to my webpage!</p>

<p> <em>It's always been my dream to travel to <strong>Scotland</strong>, specifically the Scottish Highlands. I dream of walking on rocky terrains and breathing the air surrounding the ocean and mountains. After finally pondering over this destination, I will finally be in Edinburgh and the Scottish Highlands this summer. </em> If you are also interested in going to Scotland, you can see this page for further inspiration: <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mylittleedinburgh">Scotland Itinerary</a></p>
